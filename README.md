**Recipe Generator**

**Overview**

The Recipe Generator is a full-stack application built with **Spring Boot** for the back-end and **React** for the front-end. It leverages **Spring AI** to create custom recipes based on user-provided ingredients. Users can input a list of ingredients through a web interface, and the AI will generate a recipe tailored to the ingredients provided.

## Features

- **Ingredient Input**: Users can easily enter a list of ingredients through the React front-end.
- **AI-Powered Recipe Generation**: The application uses Spring AI to generate recipes based on the input ingredients.
- **Dynamic Front-End**: The React front-end provides a seamless and responsive user interface.
- **REST API Integration**: The back-end exposes RESTful API endpoints to handle ingredient submission and recipe retrieval.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Java framework for building the back-end.
- **Spring AI**: AI integration for recipe generation.
- **Maven**: For project management and dependencies.
- **MySQL/H2 Database**: To store generated recipes (optional).
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
  
## Future Enhancements

- **Recipe Saving**: Add user authentication to save and manage favorite recipes.
- **Enhanced AI Models**: Improve the AI model for better recipe suggestions.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Allow users to filter recipes based on cuisine, diet, etc.
